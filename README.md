- Movie App for who wants to search for a word and see the movies about that word. 


- TASK FOR MYSELF IN THIS PROJECT: Build an App that users can see the popular movies at that time and if they want to search for a word they should be able to see all the movies with that word in it, also they can see the movies IMDb ratings. If there is no movie with the word that searched from the user, then display ‘’Sorry, this movie is not on our platform yet.’’ . If the movie that searched loading at that time then display ‘’Loading…’’ on the screen.

- What was the best practices for me in this project: I have used React Hooks such as useState, useContext and useEffect. Also I have fetch the popular movies live data from an API. I’ve used axios library for fetching the data.
